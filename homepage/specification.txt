HTML Tags:
<html> - This is like the top wrapper for everything. It’s there so the browser knows it's an HTML document.
<head> - This is where I put all the behind-the-scenes stuff like links to CSS or the page title.
<body> - This is where all the visible content goes, like text and images.
<header> - I used this to make the top part of my site, like the title and navigation links.
<h1> - This is the main big title for the page, like a headline.
<nav> - This is where I put all the links for navigating between pages.
<ul> - I made a list of links because it’s easier to organize them.
<li> - Each list item holds one of the navigation links.
<a> - These are the actual links that take you to other pages.
<main> - It’s like the main section of the page where the important content goes.
<section> - I used this to divide up the content inside the main area.
<h2> - This is a smaller headline for subtopics, like titles inside sections.
<p> - These are paragraphs where I put all the text.
<footer> - The bottom part of the page, like for copyrights and stuff.

CSS Selectors:
body - I styled the body to make the font Arial and add consistent spacing for all pages.
.nav-link - This class is for the navigation links. I made them white and spaced them out a bit.
.home-page h1 - This selector changes the color of the homepage title to blue.
.about-page h2 - This selector makes the about page subheading green.
